# OCPN Tools

**OCPN Tools** is a modern web application for designing **Object-centric Colored Petri Nets (OCPNs)** and generating simulated **OCEL 2.0** event logs — making what used to be a complex, StandardML-heavy workflow super easy and smooth, right in your browser.

## Features

- **Visual OCPN editor** — Create and edit places, transitions, and arcs on an interactive canvas with drag-and-drop
- **Hierarchical nets** — Model hierarchical object-centric Petri nets with substitution transitions, subpages, and fusion places
- **Declarations** — Define color sets (including record types that directly map to OCEL 2.0 objects), variables, priorities, and functions
- **Simulation** — Step through or auto-run simulations powered by [cpnsim](https://github.com/rwth-pads/cpnsim), our own CPN simulator written in Rust and cross-compiled to WebAssembly, running entirely in the browser
- **OCEL 2.0 export** — Export simulated event logs in the OCEL 2.0 standard format for process mining
- **File format support** — Open and save `.ocpn` (native JSON), `.cpn` (CPN Tools XML), and `.json` (CPNPy) files
- **Auto-layout** — Arrange nets automatically using Dagre, ELK, or our own Sugiyama-based layouting algorithm developed in our research
- **Built-in examples** — Get started instantly with the Airport Ground Handling process example via the **Open** button
- **AI assistant** — Optional AI-powered sidebar for modeling guidance (OpenAI API key required)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use OCPN Tools is the hosted version at **[rwth-pads.github.io/ocpn-tools](https://rwth-pads.github.io/ocpn-tools)**.

- Click the **?** (Help) button in the top-right corner for an interactive guide that explains the app's functionality in detail.
- Click **Open** in the top-left corner and select the built-in **Airport Ground Handling** example to explore a complete OCPN model.
- Use the **Feedback** button in the app to share your thoughts — feedback is very much welcome!
