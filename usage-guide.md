## Introduction

Welcome to OCPN Tools! This tool allows you to create, edit, and simulate Object-Centric Petri Nets (OCPNs). This guide will help you understand how to use the various features of the editor.

## Basic Navigation

- **Toolbar**: Contains tools for creating places, transitions, and arcs
- **Sidebar**: Provides access to properties and declarations
- **Canvas**: The main editing area where you build your Petri Net

## Creating Elements

### Places
- Click the circle icon in the toolbar and drag it onto the canvas
- Configure properties in the sidebar:
  - Label: Name of the place
  - Color Set: Type of tokens the place can hold
  - Initial Marking: Initial tokens in the place. This can contain code expressions like "5+2".

### Transitions
- Click the square icon in the toolbar and drag it onto the canvas
- Configure properties in the sidebar:
  - Label: Name of the transition
  - Guard: Condition that must be true for the transition to fire
  - Time: Time delay for the transition
  - Priority: Execution priority
  - Code Segment: ML code to execute when the transition fires

### Arcs
- Click on a source node, then click on a target node to create an arc
- Configure the arc inscription in the sidebar

You can use the following notation for multisets:
```
✅ [x,x] --> consume the same token twice
❌ [x,y] --> not supported to bind two tokens
✅ [x,x,x,x,x] --> consume five tokens with the same value
```

For legacy reasons, we also support the Standard ML notation used in CPN Tools:
```
✅ 2`x --> consume the same token twice
```

## Declarations

### Color Sets
Define the types of tokens that can be used in your Petri Net:
- **Basic types**: `UNIT`, `INT`, `BOOL`, `STRING`
- **Record types**: Structured objects with named fields
- **Product types**: Tuples of values

#### UNIT Color Set
The `UNIT` color set represents anonymous tokens (like classical Petri Nets). These are displayed as bullets (•) in places. Use UNIT for resources that don't need individual identity, like generic capacity tokens.

#### Record Color Sets for Object Types
For object-centric process mining, define record types with an `id` field:

```
colset Aircraft = record id: INT * typeCode: STRING * airline: STRING * carrierType: STRING;
colset Gate = record id: INT;
colset FuelTruck = record id: INT;
```

**Important**: The `id` field is used to uniquely identify objects in OCEL 2.0 exports. Without an `id` field, objects cannot be properly tracked across events.

### Variables
Define variables that can be used in arc inscriptions and guards.

```
ac : Aircraft
gate : Gate
ft : FuelTruck
```

### Functions
Define Rhai functions that can be used in your Petri Net.

## Rhai Scripting Language

OCPN Tools uses [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) as its scripting language for guards, arc inscriptions, and functions.

### Basic Syntax

```rhai
// Variables and arithmetic
let x = 5;
let y = x + 10;

// Conditionals
if x > 3 { "big" } else { "small" }

// Functions
fn double(n) { n * 2 }
```

### Record Access (Dot Syntax)

Access record fields using dot notation:

```rhai
// Given: ac is an Aircraft with fields id, typeCode, airline, carrierType

ac.id           // Access the id field
ac.airline      // Access the airline field
ac.carrierType  // Access the carrierType field

// Use in guards:
ac.carrierType == "full"    // Check if carrier is full-service
ac.airline == "LH"          // Check if airline is Lufthansa
```

### Guards

Guards are boolean expressions that control when a transition can fire:

```rhai
// Simple comparison
ac.carrierType == "full"

// Multiple conditions with AND
ac.carrierType == "full" && ac.airline == "LH"

// Multiple conditions with OR
ac.carrierType == "low" || ac.airline == "FR"

// Numeric comparisons
order.quantity > 10
```

### Arc Inscriptions

Arc inscriptions define which tokens are consumed or produced:

```rhai
// Simple variable (consume/produce a token bound to ac)
ac

// UNIT token literal
()

// Conditional expression
if order.priority == "high" { fastTrack } else { normalQueue }
```

## Code Expressions

Code expressions can be used for arc inscriptions, guards, and initial markings.

Here are some examples of valid code expressions for arc inscriptions:

```
✅ 1
✅ var1
✅ "test"
```
OCPN Tools will always try to bind a variable, therefore, a simple string like this will not work (except if "test" is a declared variable):
```
❌ test
```
You can even use a ternary expression like this:
```
✅ if y < 2 { 5 } else { 10 }
```

## Simulation

### Running Simulations

1. Switch to the **Simulation** tab
2. Click **Step** to execute one transition at a time
3. Click **Run** to execute multiple steps automatically
4. Use **Reset** to return to the initial marking

### Event Log

The simulation records all transition firings in the Event Log:
- Each event shows consumed and produced tokens
- UNIT tokens are displayed as bullets (•)
- Expand an event to see full token details

## OCEL 2.0 Export

Export your simulation as an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL 2.0) for process mining analysis.

### How It Works

1. Run a simulation to generate events
2. Click **Export as OCEL 2.0**
3. Choose JSON format

### Object Types and IDs

**Critical**: For proper OCEL 2.0 export, your record color sets should have an `id` field:

```
colset Order = record id: INT * customer: STRING * amount: INT;
```

- The `id` field becomes the unique object identifier
- Other fields become object attributes
- Objects are tracked across events automatically

### Object Type Prefixes

To avoid ID collisions between different object types, exported object IDs are prefixed with the type name:

| Color Set | Token | OCEL Object ID |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Aircraft  | `{id: 1, ...}` | `aircraft_1` |
| Gate      | `{id: 2}` | `gate_2` |
| FuelTruck | `{id: 1}` | `fueltruck_1` |

### Event Relationships with Qualifiers

Each event records which objects were involved, with qualifiers indicating the object type:

```json
{
  "id": "e5",
  "type": "Fueling Start",
  "relationships": [
    { "objectId": "aircraft_3", "qualifier": "aircraft" },
    { "objectId": "fueltruck_1", "qualifier": "fueltruck" }
  ]
}
```

### What Gets Exported

| OCPN Element | OCEL 2.0 Element |
|--------------|------------------|
| Record Color Sets | Object Types |
| Record tokens with `id` | Objects |
| Transitions | Event Types |
| Transition firings | Events |
| Record fields (except id) | Object Attributes |

**Note**: UNIT color sets and basic types (INT, STRING, BOOL) are not exported as object types since they don't represent trackable objects.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use the layout tools to automatically arrange your Petri Net
- Save your work frequently using the save button
- Use the AI Assistant for help with specific modeling questions
- For object-centric modeling, always include an `id` field in your record types
- Use meaningful names for transitions—they become event types in OCEL exports

## Random Distribution Functions

OCPN Tools supports all 14 random distribution functions from CPN Tools for stochastic simulations. These can be used in time delay inscriptions, arc inscriptions, and guards.

### Available Distributions

| Function | Parameters | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `bernoulli(p)` | p: probability (0-1) | Returns 1 with probability p, 0 otherwise |
| `beta(a, b)` | a, b: shape parameters (> 0) | Beta distribution on (0, 1) |
| `binomial(n, p)` | n: trials (≥ 1), p: probability | Number of successes in n independent trials |
| `chisq(n)` | n: degrees of freedom (≥ 1) | Chi-squared distribution |
| `discrete(a, b)` | a, b: integers (a ≤ b) | Random integer uniformly in [a, b] |
| `erlang(n, r)` | n: shape (≥ 1), r: rate (> 0) | Erlang distribution (sum of n exponentials) |
| `exponential(r)` | r: rate (> 0) | Exponential distribution with mean 1/r |
| `gamma(l, k)` | l: scale (> 0), k: shape (> 0) | Gamma distribution |
| `normal(m, v)` | m: mean, v: variance (≥ 0) | Gaussian/normal distribution |
| `poisson(m)` | m: mean (> 0) | Poisson distribution |
| `rayleigh(s)` | s: scale (≥ 0) | Rayleigh distribution |
| `student(n)` | n: degrees of freedom (≥ 1) | Student's t-distribution |
| `uniform(a, b)` | a, b: bounds (a ≤ b) | Continuous uniform on [a, b] |
| `weibull(lambda, k)` | lambda: scale (> 0), k: shape (> 0) | Weibull distribution |

### Using Distributions in Time Delays

Time delays can use random distributions for realistic process modeling. Combine delay functions with distributions:

```rhai
// Exponential service time with mean 10 minutes (rate = 1/10 = 0.1)
delay_min(exponential(0.1))

// Normal processing time: mean 30 min, variance 25 (std dev = 5 min)
delay_min(normal(30.0, 25.0))

// Uniform delay between 5 and 15 seconds
delay_sec(uniform(5.0, 15.0))

// Erlang distribution for multi-phase service (k=3 phases, rate=0.2)
delay_min(erlang(3, 0.2))
```

### Practical Examples

**Airport Ground Handling:**

```rhai
// Landing takes 4-6 minutes (uniform)
delay_min(uniform(4.0, 6.0))

// Fueling time: exponential with mean 20 min (rate = 0.05)
delay_min(exponential(0.05))

// Passenger boarding: normal, mean 25 min, variance 25
delay_min(normal(25.0, 25.0))
```

**Manufacturing Process:**

```rhai
// Machine processing with Weibull distribution
delay_min(weibull(100.0, 2.5))

// Random batch size between 1 and 10
discrete(1, 10)
```

### Using Distributions in Arc Inscriptions

```rhai
// Produce a token with random quantity
{ id: nextId(), quantity: discrete(1, 10) }

// Random sensor reading
{ sensor: s.id, value: normal(20.0, 4.0) }
```

### Using Distributions in Guards

```rhai
// 80% chance of taking this path
bernoulli(0.8) == 1

// Only process if random value exceeds threshold
uniform(0.0, 1.0) > 0.3
```

## Migration Guide

After importing a CPN in the .cpn format of CPN Tools, some manual adjustments are necessary. Here are the most common ones:

- Guards like `[items = doSomething(order)]` need to be changed to `items = doSomething(order)` (remove the square brackets)
- Functions need to be translated from Standard ML to Rhai (a scripting language embeddable to Rust). We recommend either doing that manually or with the help of an LLM like ChatGPT. The recommended prompt is `Please turn this Standard ML into Rhai script (Rust embedded): fun doo(x: INT): INT = x+1;`. The outcome can be pasted into the function editor of OCPN Tools.

### Standard ML to Rhai Conversion Examples

| Standard ML | Rhai |
|-------------|------|
| `fun f(x) = x + 1` | `fn f(x) { x + 1 }` |
| `if x > 0 then a else b` | `if x > 0 { a } else { b }` |
| `#field record` | `record.field` |
| `hd list` | `list[0]` |
| `tl list` | `list.split(1).1` |
| `length list` | `list.len()` |
